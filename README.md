# üóÇÔ∏è Project Portfolio

Welcome to my **Project Portfolio** repository! This repository contains a collection of my data science, machine learning, and programming projects that I‚Äôve worked on. Each project showcases different aspects of my skills, ranging from exploratory data analysis, model building, optimization, and more.

Each folder in this repository contains the relevant code, data (where applicable), and a detailed explanation of the approach taken, along with any results or conclusions.

## üöÄ Future Work
Some of the models and techniques explored in this portfolio have room for further improvement. In future projects, I plan to experiment with:
- **SARIMAX**: Seasonal ARIMA with exogenous variables for time series forecasting.
- **XGBoost**: A powerful gradient boosting framework for structured data.
