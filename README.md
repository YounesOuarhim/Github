# 😎​ About Me

Hi, I’m Younes Ouarhim, a second-year engineering student at Paris-Saclay University with a passion for data science and statistics. I enjoy exploring the world of mathematical modeling and machine learning to solve real-world problems. I am currently seeking a 6-month internship starting in February, focusing on data science, mathematical modeling, or machine learning. Feel free to browse through my portfolio and reach out if you'd like to connect!

# 🗂️ Project Portfolio

Welcome to my **Project Portfolio** repository! This repository contains a collection of my data science, machine learning, and programming projects that I’ve worked on. Each project showcases different aspects of my skills, ranging from exploratory data analysis, model building, optimization, and more.

Each folder in this repository contains the relevant code, data (where applicable), and a detailed explanation of the approach taken, along with any results or conclusions.

## 🚀 Future Work
Some of the models and techniques explored in this portfolio have room for further improvement. In future projects, I plan to experiment with:
- **SARIMAX**: Seasonal ARIMA with exogenous variables for time series forecasting.
- **XGBoost**: A powerful gradient boosting framework for structured data.
